# here-to-say
This is going to be stupid in a major way.

## Overview

This is a Chrome extension that wraps every comment in a Reddit thread in the following text:

`My name is <username> and I'm here to say: <comment> ...in a major way`

Just go to your Chrome extension list, enable developer mode, load this folder in, and then go to a reddit comment page.

I apologize.
